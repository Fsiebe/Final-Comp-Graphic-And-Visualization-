README - Project Reflection
How do I approach designing software?
When I’m designing software, I like to break things down into small, clear parts first. I think about what I’m trying to build, then list out the pieces I’ll need and how they should connect. I usually sketch out a rough plan (either in my head or on paper) before touching any code.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me get better at thinking visually. Before, I mostly thought about code logically, but now I think more about layout, lighting, and how small changes can totally change how a scene feels. I also got better at organizing my project files.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed a simple plan: look at the sample project, figure out what I wanted to make, and then build one piece at a time. I made a basic version first and kept adjusting it based on how it actually looked once it was running.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Taking things step-by-step and adjusting based on what actually happens (instead of overthinking at the start) is something I’ll definitely use in future coding and design projects. It keeps things way more manageable.

How do I approach developing programs?
I usually focus on building a working version first, even if it’s super basic. Once it works, then I add more features or polish things up. I’ve learned that trying to make everything perfect from the beginning just slows you down.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I got better at testing small changes as I went. Instead of building a ton at once and hoping it worked, I tested little things (like one light or one object) before moving forward. It made finding bugs way easier.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was a huge part of this project. I'd run the program, see what needed fixing, tweak it, and repeat. Sometimes I had to tweak lighting five or six times before it looked decent. It taught me patience.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
At first, I was trying to get everything “right” immediately. Over time, I learned that just getting something functional first, even if it’s rough, makes it easier to polish later. That made the milestones a lot less stressful.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science gives me the ability to create stuff, automate boring tasks, and solve real-world problems. No matter what path I take, these skills will help me be more independent and creative in my work.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Learning 3D graphics helped me think about problems visually, not just through numbers and logic. That’s super useful for future classes, especially anything involving data visualization or simulations.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Being able to make visuals that show information clearly is a big skill in pretty much any field. Whether it’s tech, business, or even education, showing complex stuff in a simple visual way makes it easier for others to understand and act on.
